# Grocery Store Management System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive management system designed for neighborhood grocery stores. It features both a **supplier interface** and a **store owner interface**, enabling order placement, and tracking.

## Features
- **Supplier Interface**:
  - Registration and login for suppliers.
  - Ability to view and confirm store orders.
  - Option to update order status.

- **Store Owner Interface**:
  - Ability to place orders with suppliers.
  - View and update the status of orders.

- **Bonus Feature (Automatic Stock Replenishment)**:
  - The system monitors stock levels.
  - When a productâ€™s stock falls below the minimum threshold, an automatic order is placed with the supplier offering the most competitive price for that product.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js (`grocery-app-server`)
- **Frontend**: React (`grocery-app-client`)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API**: RESTful API for communication between client and server.

## How It Works
- **Supplier Login**: Suppliers can register and log in to manage their orders.
- **Order Management**: Store owners can place orders, track their status, and confirm deliveries.
- **Automatic Ordering**: The system automatically places orders with the supplier offering the best price when stock falls below the threshold.
